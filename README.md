# AirBeds

An experiment in the use of ElasticSearch with React to create an AirBnB clone, following Siddharth Kothari's [tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/build-an-airbnb-clone-with-react-and-elasticsearch). The search dataset focuses on Seattle in 2017. Each result card links to the relevant AirBnB page.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
